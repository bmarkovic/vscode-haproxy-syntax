# HAProxy for Visual Studio Code

This is the syntax highlighter for HAProxy/HAPEE configuration files, based on [sublime-haproxy](https://github.com/ramonfritsch/sublime-haproxy) Sublime Text package.

See:
https://www.haproxy.com/ (HAPEE)
http://www.haproxy.org/ (HAProxy)


## Features

- Syntax highlighting for HAProxy configuration files (`haproxy.cfg`), greatly expanded from Sublime Original, and adjusted to better fit VS Code coloring schemas
- Basic snippets for most common blocks of configuration text i.e. *frontends, backends, listeners, acls, userlists*
- A *global/default* config starter template -- available as a snippet.

## Known Issues

Currently it will automatically triger only on files called "haproxy.cfg" verbatim, but you can always set syntax manually by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd>, <kbd>M</kbd> and then typing `haproxy` or selecting from the drop down.

## Release Notes
